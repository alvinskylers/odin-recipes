    <h3>Indgredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>150g (1 cup) plain flour</li>
        <li>150g (1 cup) self-raising flour</li>
        <li>220g (1 cup) caster sugar</li>
        <li>190g (1 cup) dark Choc Bits</li>
        <li>125g butter, melted</li>       
        <li>1 egg, lightly beaten</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180°C/160°C fan forced. Line 2 large baking trays with baking paper.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Sift the plain flour and self-raising flour into a medium bowl. Add the sugar and Choc Bits and stir well to combine.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place butter and egg in a small bowl and mix thoroughly. Pour into the flour mixture and stir until combined.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Place the dough between 2 sheets of baking paper and roll out to 5mm thickness. Place in the fridge for 20 minutes. Using a 6cm round cutter, cut rounds, re rolling to use up all the dough and place on baking trays. Bake for 18-20 minutes or until the biscuits spread slightly and are light golden.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove from oven and set aside to cool completely on the trays. Repeat with remaining biscuit mixture.</li>
    </ol>
