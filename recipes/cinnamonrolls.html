   <h3>Indgredients</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>360g pkt store-bought bake at home croissants, thawed</li>
    <li>1/3 cup cinnamon sugar</li>
    <li>100g Caramilk chocolate, melted, cooled</li>
    <li>100ml vanilla custard</li>
    <li>1/2 cup Crunchy Nut cornflakes, lightly crushed</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>Roll out croissants and place shiny-side up on a flat surface, gently stretching the dough. Sprinkle with cinnamon sugar. Roll up and cut in half. Place cut-side down and insert your index finger into the centre to flatten and stretch the scroll.</li>
    <br> 
    <li>Arrange scrolls, cut-side down, into the basket of an air fryer, allowing for a 1cm gap between each scroll. You may need to do this in 2 batches.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Air fry at 170C for 7 minutes or until golden. Leave to sit in the hot air fryer for a further 5 minutes (see note). Transfer to a serving plate.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Drizzle with Caramilk and custard, and sprinkle over Crunchy Nut corn flakes. Watch our step-by-step video below to see how to make these Air fryer Caramilk cinnamon rolls.</li>
